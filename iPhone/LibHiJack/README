LibHiJack is a simple library that contains the raw communication interface.
It makes it easy to interact at the lowest level with a HiJack device by
sending and receiving bytes.

How to use this library
=======================

Adding the library to your project
----------------------------------

LibHiJack can be compiled as a static library. There are several resources
online that show you how to add a static library to your project. The
simplest way is to open the project, and make it. Then, add the libHiJack.a
and HiJackMgr.h to your iPhone application.

Short usage example
-------------------

In your application where you plan to send and receive bytes, include the
header file

#import "HiJackMgr.h"

Make your main class a delegate for the HiJackDelegate, and add a HiJackMgr
pointer, e.g.

@interface aurioTouchAppDelegate : NSObject <UIApplicationDelegate, EAGLViewDelegate, HiJackDelegate> {
  ...
  HiJackMgr*					hiJackMgr;
  ...
}

In your 'applicationDidFinishLoading' initialize the HiJack object and
register for its Delegate

	hiJackMgr = [[HiJackMgr alloc] init];
	[hiJackMgr setDelegate:self];

All you are left to do is to write the receive function

-(int) receive:(UInt8)data
{
  ...
}

And use the HiJackMgr pointer to send bytes

	[hiJackMgr send:[slider value]];

Note that the return value of send is 0 if the send is successful, and 1 if
it failed (i.e. HiJack is busy sending something).
